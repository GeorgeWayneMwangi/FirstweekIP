    <h1>THE START OF MY JOURNEY AS A PROGRAMMER.</h1>
    <p>Hey there.Yes you. Don't be shy. I don't bite....<em>usually</em>.ðŸ˜‚</p>
    <p>My name is George Wayne Mwangi and I am a superhero</p>.

    <p>I was raised in the NGL and through rigorous training, I became the strongest man on this planet.<strong>I am sorry Saitama and his fans.</strong><em>Anime reference</em></p>
    <p>I am just messing around..lol..</p>
    <p>So, you are here to see my awesome...or crappy page(Be nice) for my programming portfolio.So,lemme start by giving you a little introduction about myself.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>As I mentioned before,my name is George Wayne Mwangi and I am superhero.<em>Just incase you missed the first part..hehe</em>I am a full time student persuing a Bachelor's degree in Marine Engineering.And I know what you are thinking...but no,I don't talk to fishðŸ˜‚.I leave that to my buddy Aquaman.</p>
    <p>Generally, my area of study deals with the running of machinery on board a sea vessel and other offshore structures,especially the engine and auxialliay machine.So,the next time you import your car,remember to say a prayer for hardworking,oil-covered bastards in the metal containers working tirelessly to get your car to you in no time.</p>
    <p>Now,onto the juicy parts:</p>
    <p>I decided to pursue Software Engineering at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"> Moringa School</a> because:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They are amazing.</li>
      <li>They are the G.O.A.T</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In short,it is the best place to start a new direction in life due to the promise of a great future. The way they nurture the noobs like me and mould us into a force to reckon is simply without equal. Due to this, I am able to turn my interest in programming into a reality through the mentorship of great minds that form such a unique family.</p>
    <p>Rememeber I said I am a superhero..lol..I do have hobbies and I am going to tell them to you,just you.(It is going to be our little secret)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My superhero name is BadGamer(sshhh)..yes...I am gamer and do enjoy playing Call of Duty and fifa.</li>
      <li>I also enjoy watching anime.Lemme show you my favorite fight scene.<iframe width="805" height="337" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AL0tkWJBtyc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>"></li>
      <li>My goal is to become a polyglot,so I am learning the Korean language.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you for still being on my page upto this point.Now let us get into the technical details.</p>
    <p>I have been able to get started on this journey by trying out a couple of simple projects through the help of my technical mentor and peers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/hello-world">Hello world(Written in HTML and CSS and is my introduction to the programming world)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/corrected-cookie-recipe">Cookie recipe(Written in HTML and CSS. This is a corrected cookie recipe that i worked on after cloning a repository from Github)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/resort-website">Resort Website(Written in HTML and CSS. This is an exercise to practice styling using CSS)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/happytrails">Happy Trails Travel Agency website(Written in HTML and CSS. It is an exercise to practice using classes and IDs)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/my-first-webpage">My first webpage</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I know, i know..it is not fancy but remember,A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I will steadily improve through practice and will eventually be the best.I am a superhero after all..hehe..</p>
    <p>As I leave to go save the day,I will live you with a quote from Mahatma Gandhi</p>
    <p><em>Live as if you were to die tomorrow.Learn as if you were to live forever.</em></p>
